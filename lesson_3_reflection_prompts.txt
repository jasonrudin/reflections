When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are going to be using multiple computers, when you are going to be collaborating on a project with multiple people, or when you want an extra backup not on your computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You aren't always going to be in control of your remote repository, so there may be changes that you don't want (yet) in the remote repository that you don't want/would break the local repository.
